Note that this is not the full set of JavaScript files available for MarkdownDeep, rather just a subset
required to back the angularjsMarkdowndeep component.

The files available at http://www.toptensoftware.com/markdowndeep/, both .NET and JavaScript components are
out of date compared to the public source code repository at https://github.com/toptensoftware/markdowndeep.

Specifically ``` (backtick) demarked code blocks were not supported.

A fork has been taken at https://github.com/appsoftware/markdowndeep/. Note that it appeared that the uncompressed .js source files were ahead of the minified versions in the source repo, and so it assumed that these are also out of date, and only uncompressed versions have been copied to this project.


The corresponding server side processing code is compatible and the most uptodate verion is also available from https://github.com/appsoftware/markdowndeep/ or https://github.com/toptensoftware/markdowndeep

Use of the appsoftware fork is recommended as both client side and server side markdown processing have been tested together.
